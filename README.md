## Project Info

**Psychopass** is just a fun side project built around an **emotion classifier**, but I also designed it to be a **useful and easy-to-use chat storage**.  It lets you store chats you may not need anymore or want to remove from your messengers without losing them completely.

If you think this project is any cool consider giving it a **star** I would really appreciate that! (*≧ω≦*)

## Main Features

### Fully Local
All messages are stored in a local **SQLite3 database** on your device so all your data stays with you.

### Emotion Classifier
Sorts your messages by emotion so you can explore and rediscover old messages as well as the ones you may not want to see anymore 👀  
Basically acts as the non-chronological message provider to make storing chats more interesting.

### Database Management
- Change avatars, names, and manage **your data** however you want  
- **. . . LINK AND MERGE! . . .**

### Memory Search
Search your messages with **both vector and linear search engines**.
